Tasks:

	1. Models
		- Splines / B-Splines
		- Bezier Curves
		- Clothoid
		- Sliding Window
	
	2. ROI Calculator
		- Vanishing Point
		- Edge-Density

	3. Preprocessors
		- Canny - Rough Draft (Need to add error defeat)
		- Hough - Rough Draft (Need to add error defeat)

	5. Hyperparameter Tuning
		- Best params for both preprocessing and regression
		- GridSearchCV-like function

	6. Batch Processing
		- Separate class that handles batch processing (e.g., making multiple instances of CannyLaneDetector() and iterating through them to perform lane detection)

	9. Auto-calc best resize for both mosaic and inset view
		- Instead of fixed param for cv2.resize, identify method for dynamic calculation based on users window size

	11. Identify classification mechanism for lane lines drawn
		- What do the lines do?
		- How are they indicators of actions a driver should take?
		- What is the capacity of the lines to drive action or inform understanding?

	12. BEV Transform / Inverse
		- Identify more robust mechanism for calculation dest. pts. Current approach is very finicky and user-input dependent.
		- Identify best place for BEV Transform to occur (e.g., before thresholding, after feature extraction, etc.)

	14. Benchmark / Profiling
		- Identify potential bottlenecks and evaluate runtime
		- Compare runtime between models, methods (i.e., Canny w/ BEV, Canny w/ out BEV, Hough w/ BEV, Hough w/ out BEV, and all with RANSAC, OLS, Sliding RANSAC, etc.)
